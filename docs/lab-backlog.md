# Lab Backlog

*Experiment concepts agreed 2026-07-16, evening session. Parent documents: founding record, website spec, handoff. BDL-003 Novgorod Letters is specced and in build; everything here comes after. Each concept gets its own spec at its own build time, per house practice.*

## Numbering vs build order

BDL-004 originally reserved the Painting (view-source CSS feat). Reassigned 2026-07-16 evening: the goal right now is quick wins before the link spreads, the Painting is the most expensive item on this page, and 003 is already a heavy build. The Loom takes 004; the Painting returns to the backlog unnumbered and gets a number at its own build time.

## Concepts, ranked by projected effort (lowest first)

### 1. BDL-004 · The Loom · artistic · mobile-native

**Specced 2026-07-16:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-bdl-004-the-loom-design.md`. The paragraphs below are the pre-spec sketch, kept for the record.

Generative woven textile. Pick warp and weft colors, pick a draft pattern, watch the cloth weave itself thread by thread on canvas. Download the finished cloth as a wallpaper. Craft rather than nature: tactile like 003's dig, but a different sense entirely, and not a tree in sight.

Why cheapest: the weave math is a grid of over/under decisions driven by the draft, plain canvas2D rendering, and controls the styleguide pattern already knows how to build. The polish budget goes to making the thread render feel like fiber instead of pixels.

### 2. The Orrery · artistic · mobile-native

A working solar system, planets where they actually are right now, at real ephemeris accuracy. Drag time to scrub across centuries. Brass-and-ink instrument aesthetic. Artistic face, serious math underneath: the living, time-based ethos of the site without a single birch.

Effort sits in the ephemeris math (simplified Kepler elements are well published and unit-testable) and in making the time scrub feel like handling an instrument rather than a slider.

### 3. The Type Instrument · technical · desktop-forward

Sibling of the styleguide, for typography. Paste your own text, play with scale ratios, pairings, measure, and leading; watch live rag and x-height comparisons; copy tokens out. Follows the proven instrument-to-curated-room model: full internal tool first, curated public room when controls prove interesting.

The one deliberate reusable tool in this batch. Every client site needs type decisions, so this pays rent forever. Effort is UI breadth rather than hard problems, and the styleguide provides the pattern to copy. Mobile gets a reduced view with the DeviceBadge treatment.

### 4. The Software Renderer · technical · mobile-usable

A 3D scene rasterized from scratch on canvas2D. No WebGL, no library: projection, z-buffer, lighting, all handwritten and readable. Touch-orbit on mobile with resolution scaled to the device, since a CPU rasterizer on phone silicon wants a low-poly scene. The specimen plate explains the pipeline stage by stage. The credential: we understand rendering down to the pixel.

Bounded, well-trodden math, but a lot of it, and the scene itself needs art direction to be worth staring at.

### 5. The Painting · technical · mobile-usable

The view-source CSS feat, now a concept. Unnumbered since 2026-07-16; takes a number at its own build time. One museum-grade illustration built from pure CSS: no images, no SVG, no JS. Hundreds of hand-placed gradients and shadows. The page shows the plate and an invitation to view source; the gasp is in devtools, where the whole painting reads as a clean, commented, human stylesheet.

Subject parked until spec time, with one constraint agreed: lean into gradient and shadow, because that is what CSS painting does best. Maximize the flex.

Most expensive item here: the cost is artisan hours placing gradients until the subject breathes, and the museum-grade bar (set by 003) applies in full.

## Shelved experiment concepts

Liked, not dead. Revisit when the moment fits.

- **Tonight's Sky.** Star chart of the visitor's actual sky, computed client-side from clock and location. Shelved because the location permission prompt ruins immersion; Lab pieces stay permission-free for now. Revisit when heavier location-needing work makes the prompt worth it. Overlaps the Orrery conceptually anyway; the Orrery scratches the itch without asking anything.
- **One Kilobyte.** Entire experiment, markup plus style plus script, under 1024 bytes, live byte counter on the page. Demoscene discipline, pure optimization flex. Shelved as a someday treat, not a priority.

## Parked site notes (not experiments)

Side ideas from earlier sessions, gathered here so the handoff stops carrying them:

- **Bark peel.** Tap becomes the shed trigger on the living bark. Its own future round on the bark engine.
- **Client-study section.** Director's commentary on a client site once one exists to narrate.
- **From-the-Lab recency switch.** Home section flips to recency ordering at 4+ live entries.
- **Lab visual identity.** The Lab will eventually branch away from the professional site theme and grow its own style. Nothing decided; also tracked as handoff open thread 4. Worth deciding before the Lab has many live pieces, since each experiment currently inherits site tokens.
- **Presentation ceiling (the awwwards note).** Founder browsed awwwards 2026-07-16 and found the backlog concepts presentation-modest by comparison. Diagnosis agreed: the concepts' substance is the differentiator (working systems, not demo shells), but the specs say little about arrival, motion, and material feel. Action when ready: define the Lab's presentation language (entrance beats, transition grammar, motion budget; GSAP is already reserved for Lab pieces) under the Lab visual identity thread, optionally preceded by a study session naming which awwwards techniques to steal and which scroll-jack noise to skip. The Loom would ship as the language's first full expression. Founder installed a front-end design plugin for this work.
- **Bark-generated OG images.** Seeded bark rendered into per-page OpenGraph images at build time. Flagged as "a nice later touch" in the website spec's SEO section. Specced 2026-07-16: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-bark-og-images-design.md`.
- **Per-experiment OG art.** Each Lab piece gets its own OG card instead of sharing the catalog's. Worthwhile once the catalog holds about a dozen live experiments.
- **Daily OG rebuild.** Cloudflare deploy hook on a cron so the OG card's tree is truly daily rather than tree-of-last-deploy. Only matters if platform OG caching ever stops making it moot.
- **GSAP as a Lab-piece technology.** Banned from the core site by the spec, deliberately reserved for a future Lab experiment that wants heavyweight motion. No concept attached yet.
- **Heavier location-aware work.** Founder intends eventually to build pieces that justify a location permission prompt. When that day comes, Tonight's Sky (shelved above) comes off the shelf with it.

## Documented renovation paths (recorded elsewhere, listed for completeness)

These are not ideas to develop here; the website spec and core plan already carry them: contact form via Cloudflare Pages Functions, Sanity CMS swap via Content Layer loader, Tailwind as a per-island addition, Google Workspace for send-as on hello@.
